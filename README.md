# userosproject
UserOS is a VB 2017 OS trying to be it's own thing.
It is almost the same as the LightOS project.
However, it has been more worked on. (Because I forgot about LightOS)
UserOS is made in .NET 4.0, so you can run it on something like Windows XP.
It has the same icons, but originally it didn't.


It's simple.

Please enjoy.
